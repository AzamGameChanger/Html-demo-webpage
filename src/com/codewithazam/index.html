      <h2>Welcome to my first HTML webpage</h2>
      <p>For many people, information technology <b>(IT)</b> is basically synonymous with the guys and gals you call when you need help with a computer issue. While that view of information technology isn’t totally wrong, it drastically understates the scope of this critical career field.</br>
          If you’re looking to get a better handle on what information technology is and the many facets of this field, then you’ve come to the right place. We’ve done the digging for you and spoke with IT industry pros to create this helpful beginner’s guide to the field.

          <h3>Top 3 best websites to learn IT.</h3>
          <li>Programmiz</li>

          <li>Geekforgeeks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So how does this distinction apply to an IT career? Nearly every IT job requires a blend of hardware and software-based know-how. Some IT workers may spend more time working with configuring hardware components, but those components are also governed by software. Additionally, IT professionals are responsible for deploying and setting up software applications for users.

          <h3>IT departments</h3>
          <li>IT governance</li>
          <li>IT operations</li>
          <li>Hardware and infrastructure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even though an organization’s IT department handles many different functions and plays a critical role in keeping things running, Andrey Prokopchuk, head of IT at Belitsoft, says the perfect IT department is the one you aren’t even aware of. This means that they are able to automate and create processes for many of their daily tasks, so that the business continues to run smoothly. The ideal IT department is also aligned with the business’s goals and transparent in its processes in a way that the rest of the business can understand and provide input on.</p>
